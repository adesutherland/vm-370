This update implements support for clearing REXX related
Nucleus fields during ABEND processing. REXX EXEC trace
and Halt Interpretation flags were not reset properly.
 
This update fixes errors in the HRC402DS update.
 
Updates for assemble files:
 
DMSEXC   HRC410DS
 
 
Steps to apply:
 
1. Add the line below, as the top line in the top level AUX file for
   the changed files listed above: (In an unmodified Sixpack, the
   top level AUX file has filetype AUXHRC.)
 
HRC410DS V01 Reset REXX immediate cmds and depth counter in ABEND
 
2. Recompile all new or updated assembler files. (In an unmodified
   Sixpack, the assembler source control file is DMSHRC CNTRL.)
 
   VMFASM DMSEXC DMSHRC
 
3. Rebuild the CMS nucleus using VMFLOAD with the
   CMSLOAD EXEC build list, and IPL the nucleus
   punch file to write the CMS nucleus on the disk.

                                              to the spool input queue

This update supports calling REXX external functions with
a call type X'05' plist. When an EXEC is called with this
plist, control is always passed to REXX, since the original
EXEC processor does not support this call type. The eplist
is not updated in any way but is passed to the REXX
processor unmodified.
 
Updates for assembler files:
 
DMSEXC   HRC408DS  - Add logic to bypass eplist manipulation
                     when the call type is X'05'
 
Steps to apply:
 
1. Add the line below, as the top line in the top level AUX file for
   the changed files listed above: (In an unmodified Sixpack, the
   top level AUX file has filetype AUXHRC.)
 
HRC408DS V01 Support call type X'05' for REXX functions
 
2. Recompile the updated assembler files. (In an unmodified
   Sixpack, the assembler source control file is DMSHRC CNTRL.)
 
   VMFASM DMSEXC DMSHRC
 
3. Rebuild the CMS nucleus using VMFLOAD with the
   CMSLOAD EXEC build list, and IPL the nucleus
   punch file to write the CMS nucleus on the disk.
